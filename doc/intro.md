# Introduction to sk

## What is sk?
- Template to generate a full stack webpage:
  1. Clojure as language.
  2. MySQL as database.
  3. Bootstrap for styling.
  4. Easyui for the views.
- Builder to build:
  1. Handler
  2. Model
  3. View

## Getting Started
You will need an editor that can be configured to work nicely with clojure. I use **neovim**, but I also recommend **code**.
